# Build a Chatbot with Python

## Overview
In this capstone project, we will create a presentation that showcases a well-built generative chatbot system.

## Goal
Apply our deep-learning knowledge and chatbot savvy to build an open-domain generative chatbot using a stream of tweets on a weather topic. During this project, 
- we will use a seq2seq LSTM network built with Keras and create a chatbot that is able to handle user input and language that wasnâ€™t part of the training data;
- we will build a user interface GUI for our chatbot;

## Data sources
We use weather.txt data that Codecademy provides with us. It contains tweets  and replies collected from twiiter.

## Action
- Import Python librairies
- Load in the dataset
- Implemente a generative natural language processing and machine learning techniques
- Build a chat GUI using tkinter library.

## Conclusion
- Analyse our findings
- Conclude
